# Liquefaction

A small app to check whether lots are in a liquifaction zone. An SF Brigade project.

This app will live at www.sfcapss.org/softstory, allowing property owners to check whether they are in certain zones. We're doing this because the City of San Francisco recently passed an ordinance requiring a some homes to undergo mandatory retrofits, making these mostly large apartment buildings safer in an Earthquake. Building owners have to follow a timeline for retrofitting, part of which is determined by soil status.

## Use on your site

To add the form itself to a webpage, copy everything between `<body>` and `</body>` (don't include the tags!). Paste into the area you want your form to go.

To add the javascript, copy everything between `<script>` and `</script>`. Paste into the section after `</body>`, inside the `<script>` tag.

Finally, add the CSS. Copy everything between `<style>` and `</style>` (it's up at the top). Paste into the `<style>` section in the head.
