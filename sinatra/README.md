liquifaction
============

A small app to check whether lots are in a liquifaction zone. An [SF Brigade](https://github.com/sfbrigade) project.

This app will live at www.sfcapss.org/softstory, allowing property owners to check whether they are in certain zones. We're doing this because the City of San Francisco recently passed an ordinance requiring a some homes to undergo mandatory retrofits, making these mostly large apartment buildings safer in an Earthquake. Building owners have to follow a timeline for retrofitting, part of which is determined by soil status.
